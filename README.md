**Bulk Image Resizer** is a powerful tool designed to help you resize multiple images at once. This application allows you to upload multiple images, specify the desired width and height, choose a fit option (cover, contain, fill, inside, or outside), and set a background color. Once you upload your images and specify the options, our tool processes each image using high-quality settings to ensure the best output. The resized images are then made available for download in a compressed zip file.

**How It Works**
The tool leverages the power of Node.js and the Sharp library for image processing. When you upload images, they are sent to our server, where each image is resized according to your specifications. The processed images are stored temporarily and packaged into a zip file for easy download.

**Use Cases**
Bulk Image Resizer is ideal for various scenarios, including:

- Preparing images for a website, ensuring they fit within specific dimensions.
- Batch processing images for presentations or documents.
- Resizing images for social media, maintaining a consistent appearance across platforms.
- Creating thumbnails for videos or articles.
